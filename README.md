# JOE API Example-Client

This is a simple example client for the [JOE API](https://github.com/jacob-elektronik/joe-api-documentation) library.

It consists of two parts:

- A simple command line client to communicate with the JOE API (for now: send order only)
- A command line tool to convert other formats to the JOE API / OpenTrans 2.1 format
